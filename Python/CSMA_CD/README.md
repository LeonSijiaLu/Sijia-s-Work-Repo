# What to run

`py main.py` or `./main.py` will execute both non-persistent csma/cd and persistent csma/cd, you can see output on command line

`non_persistent_performance.txt` is one performance result I gained from experiments after running non-persistent csma/cd

`persistent_performance.txt` is one performance result I gained from experiments after running persistent csma/cd

`py draw_result.py` or `./draw_result.py` draws the graph (effciency vs nodes, throughput vs nodes when under both non-persistent and persistent). The graph data comes from the above two txt files.
